itkCollectionOfPatchesHandLabeledIterator.h   ---  ECS 189H Homework 1
January 7, 2007

This file contains the class declaration for itk::CollectionOfPatchesHandLabeledIterator.  The class iterates over a list of image regions that are extracted from images in a directory.  The image regions to be extracted are specified in a text file called ground_truth in the directory.  The first line in ground_truth is a single number: the number of image regions listed in the file.  Each following line in ground_truth specifies a different face region in a particular image.  The format for one line of ground_truth is:

<image filename> <left eye x> <left eye y> <right eye x> <right eye y> <nose x> <nose y> <left corner of mouth x> <left corner of mouth y> <center of mouth x> <center of mouth y> <right corner of mouth x> <right corner of mouth y>

For example, "left eye x" and "left eye y" are the X and Y coordinates of the left eye of the face in the image called "image filename."  This class converts each region description into a rectangular image region by taking the bounding box of the face features and adding some extra pixels to the periphery of the bounding box ("padding").  How much padding to add around the face features is controlled by the SetCushionPctX() and SetCushionPctY() methods.  The default for both is .2 (i.e. the patches add a 20% border all around).  If adding the padding to the image patch makes it extend outside the bounds of the image, the padding is cropped off so that the image patch stops at the image boundary.

The class instantiates in itk::ImageFileReader to read the images and an itk::RegionOfInterestImageFilter to extract the specified regions.

Calling SetImagePath() triggers the reading of ground_truth in the specified directory, but regions themselves are not read in from the specified image files until Get() is called.  Changing the position of the iterator by calling GoToBegin(), operator++(), etc just changes which image region is the current one but don't cause the image to be read in from file.  Get() calls the ImageFileReader to read in the image, specifies the rectangular image region based on the entry in ground_truth,  calls the RegionOfInterestImageFilter to extract that region from the image, and returns the region to the user.

Implementation:  Currently, the iterator is implemented as a simple array of structs, each of which stores information on a particular image region, and an integer index that points to an element in the array.  Methods that change the iterator position (operator++(), operator--(), operator+=(), operator-=(), GoToBegin(), GoToPosition()) just change the value of the array index in obvious ways.  Being at the end of the list of regions-- being PAST the final region in the list, not AT the final region in the list-- is represented by making the array index one greater than the maximal index of image regions in the array.  If that's where the iterator is, IsAtEnd() returns true.  GoToEnd() puts the iterator there.
